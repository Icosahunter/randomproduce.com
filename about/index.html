          <h1>About</h1>
<p>Random Produce is a silly nerdy comic by Nathaniel Markham. Inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a> (especially the &quot;Beret Guy&quot; comics), Random Produce follows the adventures of the nameless protagonist at his new job as a janitor at Random Produce Inc. as well as featuring other non-plot-related comics involving Random Produce Inc. such as product flyers.</p>
<p>If there is a bug with the website you can <a href="https://github.com/Icosahunter/randomproduce.com/issues">create an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>Why was the site down for while in 2023?</h2>
<p>Originally the site was hosted on my Dad's Host Gator account and he accidentally removed the site when going through cleaning up old stuff. I didn't have any proper backups... but I did have every single comic posted to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. As it turned out, downloading it all from Twitter was not too difficult, and so I was able to get everything back that way. This site is a brand new static site made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> static site generator and my own <a href="https://github.com/Icosahunter/condensate">Condensate</a> CSS library, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Being hosted via a Git repo also means I now have an actual backup on my PC, so hopefully it won't be such a headache in the future.</p>
<h2>Are you ever going to publish more comics here?</h2>
<p>Probably not. If I do it will be to wrap-up the last story arc I left things on. I've lost interest in the project and am currently working on other things. However, I <em>might maybe possibly</em> try making &quot;Sneet Comics&quot; a reality in the future, see <a href="https://randomproduce.com/comics/comic-nesting/">Comic Nesting</a>.</p>
